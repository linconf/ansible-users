# Ansible Role: users :: tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linconf/ansible-users.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linconf/ansible-users)

Placeholder.

Will soon link to instructions for running local tests using test-kitchen.


## Testing and Versioning

LinConf roles follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Minor versions
are intended to indicate that all operating systems listed as compatable passed
the `inspec` tests stored in the `spec.rb` file.

TravisCI tests are run on every commit and are reflected by the build badge above.
